# Skeleton App

This is a skeleton angular application with authentication and authorization features. It is designed to be as simple as possible so that it is easy to extend and can be used as a base application for developing different **MEAN** applications.

## Feature breakdown

- **Sign up**: Users can register by creating a new account using an email address
- **User list**: Any visitor can see a list of all registered users
- **Authentication**: Registered users can sign-in and sign-out
- **Protected user profile**: Only registered users can view individual user details after signing in
- **Authorized user edit and delete**: Only a registered and authenticated user can edit or remove their own user account details

## Development server
